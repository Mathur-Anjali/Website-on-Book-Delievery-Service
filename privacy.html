                    <p>
                        We market and encourage the acquisition of our goods and services among adults or with their permission. Websites operated by Bookswagon are not intended for use by those under the age of 18 (referred to as "Minors"). Children's privacy is of the utmost importance, and Book-Express.com is committed to abiding by all privacy laws made in India under Information Technology Act 2000 and Digital Personal Data Protection Act. Furthermore, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an online account or to post personal information on our websites. If we find that someone under the age of 18 has provided any personal information to or on any of the Book-Express websites, we will remove that information as soon as possible. On Book-Express.com, which does not sell items for purchase by children, any products relating to children must be purchased by adults. We do allow adult content on Book-Express, including images that may contain nudity or sexual activity. If any book contains such content, we mark it as adult content. All books marked as 'adult' will be placed behind an 'adult content' warning interstitial. There can be books that may contain covers like child abuse materials, but as an unrealistic theme that is majorly used for knowledge purposes rather than encouraging it. Involvement from the user's parents or guardians is necessary if they are under 18. We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, shipping address, billing information, and contact details when you create an account, place an order, or contact us. We collect payment information when you make a purchase, including credit card details or other payment methods. We may store records of your interactions with us, including emails, chat messages, and customer support inquiries and all these data will not be misinterpreted in future or any kind of illegal act. To stay abreast of market expectations, we frequently need to make changes to our business. The notice will change as a result, and depending on the demands of our policy at the time, the data we gather today may change.
